# PWA Homescreen Icons Setup âœ¨

## What Was Done

Your SportsClubNet logo will now display correctly when users add the app to their homescreen on iOS, Android, and desktop devices!

### Files Generated

All icons are created from `client/public/sportsclubnet-high-resolution-logo.png`:

1. **`web-app-manifest-192x192.png`** (192Ã—192)
   - Used by Android devices and Chrome PWA
   - Circular design for modern Android
   - Referenced in `manifest.webmanifest`

2. **`web-app-manifest-512x512.png`** (512Ã—512)
   - Used by Android devices and Chrome PWA
   - High-resolution for splash screens
   - Referenced in `manifest.webmanifest`

3. **`apple-touch-icon.png`** (180Ã—180)
   - Used by iOS devices (iPhone/iPad)
   - Displays when app is added to home screen
   - Referenced in `index.html`

### Configuration Files Updated

- âœ… `client/index.html` - Added cache-busting `?v=2` to manifest and apple-touch-icon
- âœ… `client/public/manifest.webmanifest` - References correct icon files
- âœ… `client/public/sw.js` - Updated service worker to cache icons (v1.0.1)
