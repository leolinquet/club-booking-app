# Deployment Checklist - Email Verification & Webhooks

## What's Being Deployed

âœ… Email verification with database columns
âœ… Resend webhook support for email event tracking
âœ… Automatic migrations on deployment
âœ… Improved email error logging

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Domain Verification in Resend

- [ ] Add `sportsclubnet.com` to Resend domains
- [ ] Add DNS records to Squarespace:
  - [ ] TXT record: `resend._domainkey` â†’ `p=MIGfMA0GCS...`
  - [ ] MX record: `send` â†’ `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` (priority 10)
  - [ ] TXT record: `send` â†’ `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`
  - [ ] TXT record: `_dmarc` â†’ `v=DMARC1; p=none;`
- [ ] Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- [ ] Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard
- [ ] Domain shows as "Verified" âœ…

### 2. Webhook Setup in Resend

- [ ] Go to Resend â†’ Webhooks
- [ ] Click "Create Webhook"
- [ ] Enter URL: `https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend`
- [ ] Select events:
  - [ ] email.sent
  - [ ] email.delivered
  - [ ] email.bounced
  - [ ] email.opened
  - [ ] email.clicked
  - [ ] email.complained
- [ ] Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_...`)

### 3. Update Render Environment Variables

Go to Render Dashboard â†’ club-booking-app â†’ Environment tab:

- [ ] Add/Update: `EMAIL_FROM=SportsClubNet <no-reply@sportsclubnet.com>`
- [ ] Add: `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...` (paste from Resend)
- [ ] Verify: `RESEND_API_KEY` is still set
- [ ] Verify: `DATABASE_URL` points to production Postgres

### 4. Code Changes Ready

- [ ] All changes committed to `login-email-verification` branch
- [ ] No syntax errors in code
- [ ] Migrations tested locally

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
cd /Users/leolopez-linquet/Documents/club-booking-app

# Check what's changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "Add email verification and webhook support

- Add email_verify_token and email_verify_expires columns to users table
- Fix sendEmail() call to use object syntax
- Add Resend webhook endpoint at /webhooks/resend
- Create email_events table to log all email events
- Add automatic migration on production deployment
- Update logging for better email debugging
"
```

### Step 2: Merge to Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge login-email-verification

# Push to GitHub (triggers Render deployment)
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to Render Dashboard â†’ club-booking-app
2. Watch the **"Events"** tab for deployment progress
3. Should see:
   ```
   Build started...
   Build succeeded
   Deploy started...
   Running migrations... (this is new!)
   ðŸš€ Starting database migration...
   âœ… Applied successfully: 018_add_email_verification_columns.sql
   âœ… Applied successfully: 019_create_email_events.sql
   ðŸŽ‰ Migration completed!
   server listening on :5051
   Deploy succeeded
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Migration Ran

Check the logs in Render for these lines:
```
ðŸš€ Starting database migration...
ðŸ“Š Connected to database: [your-db-name]
ðŸ”„ Found X new migration(s) to apply
âœ… Applied successfully: 018_add_email_verification_columns.sql
âœ… Applied successfully: 019_create_email_events.sql
```

### Step 5: Test Email Sending

#### Test 1: Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend/test
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "message": "Webhook endpoint is ready",
  "secret_configured": true
}
```

#### Test 2: Create New User

1. Go to https://www.sportsclubnet.com
2. Click "Create account"
3. Enter email: `test@example.com` (or any email)
4. Enter password
5. Submit

#### Test 3: Check Email Received

- Check inbox for verification email
- Should come from `SportsClubNet <no-reply@sportsclubnet.com>`
- Click verification link

#### Test 4: Check Webhook Events

Go to Resend Dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Your webhook â†’ Recent deliveries

Should see events like:
- `email.sent` - Email accepted
- `email.delivered` - Email delivered
- `email.opened` - (if user opened it)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Database Check

The migrations should have created:

```sql
-- These columns should exist in users table
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' 
AND column_name IN ('email_verify_token', 'email_verify_expires');

-- This table should exist
SELECT * FROM email_events LIMIT 1;
```

### Logs Check

In Render logs, search for:
- `[webhook]` - Webhook events
- `[auth]` - Authentication events
- `Verification email sent` - Successful email sends

## Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails

Check Render logs for migration errors. Common issues:

**Error: "column already exists"**
- Migration was already applied
- This is OK, migrations are idempotent

**Error: "relation does not exist"**
- Check that DATABASE_URL points to correct database
- Verify previous migrations ran successfully

### If Emails Don't Send

**Check 1: Domain verified?**
```
Go to Resend â†’ Domains â†’ sportsclubnet.com
Should show: âœ… Verified
```

**Check 2: Environment variable set?**
```
Render â†’ Environment â†’ EMAIL_FROM
Should be: SportsClubNet <no-reply@sportsclubnet.com>
```

**Check 3: API key valid?**
```
Render â†’ Environment â†’ RESEND_API_KEY
Should be: re_...
```

**Check 4: Logs show errors?**
```
Render â†’ Logs â†’ Search for "[auth] sendEmail failed"
```

### If Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Check 1: Webhook URL correct?**
```
Resend â†’ Webhooks â†’ Your webhook
URL: https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend
```

**Check 2: Events selected?**
```
At least email.sent, email.delivered should be checked
```

**Check 3: Secret configured?**
```
Render â†’ Environment â†’ RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET
Should start with: whsec_...
```

**Check 4: Test the endpoint**
```bash
curl https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend/test
```

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Option 1: Revert Code
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Rollback Migration

Migrations are designed to be safe with `IF NOT EXISTS`, but if needed:

```sql
-- Remove email verification columns (only if absolutely necessary)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS email_verify_token;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS email_verify_expires;

-- Remove email events table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS email_events;

-- Remove from migrations log
DELETE FROM _migrations_applied WHERE filename IN (
  '018_add_email_verification_columns.sql',
  '019_create_email_events.sql'
);
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Render deployment succeeds
âœ… Migrations run automatically (visible in logs)
âœ… New signups create accounts
âœ… Verification emails are sent
âœ… Webhook receives events from Resend
âœ… Events logged to `email_events` table
âœ… No errors in Render logs

## Timeline

- **Code Push**: Immediate
- **Render Build**: ~3-5 minutes
- **Migration**: ~10 seconds
- **Deployment**: ~1 minute
- **Total**: ~5-7 minutes

## Support Links

- Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
- Resend Dashboard: https://resend.com/emails
- Webhook Guide: See `WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Email Setup: See `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## After Successful Deployment

1. Test signup with your email
2. Verify email arrives
3. Click verification link
4. Check webhook events in Resend
5. Query `email_events` table to see logged events
6. Update this document with any lessons learned

## Notes

- Migrations run automatically on every deployment
- If migration already applied, it will skip (safe)
- Webhook events are logged even if email fails
- Signature verification protects against fake webhooks
- All email events are stored for analytics
