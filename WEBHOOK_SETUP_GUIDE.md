# Resend Webhook Setup Guide

## What We Just Built

‚úÖ **Webhook endpoint** at `/webhooks/resend`
‚úÖ **Database table** to log all email events
‚úÖ **Security** with signature verification
‚úÖ **Event handling** for all Resend email events

## How to Configure in Resend Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to Webhooks Section

1. Log in to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Click **"Webhooks"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create Webhook"** or **"Add Endpoint"**

### Step 2: Configure Webhook

#### Webhook URL (Production):
```
https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend
```

#### Webhook URL (Development - for testing locally):
You'll need to use a tool like **ngrok** to expose your local server:
```bash
# Install ngrok: brew install ngrok
ngrok http 5051
# Then use the https URL ngrok gives you:
https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/resend
```

#### Events to Subscribe To:

Select these events (or all):
- ‚úÖ **email.sent** - Email was accepted by Resend
- ‚úÖ **email.delivered** - Email was successfully delivered
- ‚úÖ **email.delivery_delayed** - Delivery was delayed
- ‚úÖ **email.complained** - Recipient marked as spam
- ‚úÖ **email.bounced** - Email bounced (hard or soft)
- ‚úÖ **email.opened** - Recipient opened the email
- ‚úÖ **email.clicked** - Recipient clicked a link

### Step 3: Get Webhook Secret

After creating the webhook, Resend will show you a **Signing Secret**.

**Copy this secret!** It looks like:
```
whsec_abc123xyz789...
```

### Step 4: Add Secret to Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:
Update `server/.env`:
```properties
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_abc123xyz789...
```

#### For Production (Render):
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on **club-booking-app**
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add new variable:
   - **Key:** `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - **Value:** `whsec_abc123xyz789...` (paste the secret from Resend)
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy

### Step 5: Test the Webhook

#### Test Endpoint is Ready:
```bash
curl https://club-booking-app.onrender.com/webhooks/resend/test
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "message": "Webhook endpoint is ready",
  "secret_configured": true
}
```

#### Send a Test Email:
After domain verification, send a test email:
```bash
cd server
node test-email.mjs your-email@example.com
```

Then check Resend dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí your webhook ‚Üí Recent deliveries to see the events!

## What Happens When an Event Arrives

### 1. Resend sends event to your webhook:
```json
{
  "type": "email.delivered",
  "created_at": "2025-10-24T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "email_id": "abc-123",
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "from": "no-reply@sportsclubnet.com",
    "subject": "Verify your email"
  }
}
```

### 2. Your server receives it:
- ‚úÖ Verifies the signature (security)
- ‚úÖ Logs to database (`email_events` table)
- ‚úÖ Handles specific event types
- ‚úÖ Returns 200 OK

### 3. You can query the events:
```sql
-- See all email events
SELECT * FROM email_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- See bounced emails
SELECT recipient, data FROM email_events 
WHERE event_type = 'email.bounced';

-- See who opened emails
SELECT recipient, created_at FROM email_events 
WHERE event_type = 'email.opened'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Viewing Webhook Events

### In Resend Dashboard:
1. Go to **Webhooks**
2. Click on your webhook
3. See **Recent deliveries** tab
4. See success/failure for each event sent

### In Your Database:
```bash
# Connect to local database
psql postgres://leolopez-linquet@localhost:5432/clubbooking_local

# Query events
SELECT 
  event_type, 
  recipient, 
  created_at 
FROM email_events 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;
```

### In Production Logs (Render):
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click **Logs** tab
3. Search for `[webhook]` to see webhook events

## Event Types You'll See

### email.sent
‚úâÔ∏è Email accepted by Resend and queued for delivery

### email.delivered
‚úÖ Email successfully delivered to recipient's inbox

### email.bounced
‚ùå Email bounced - recipient address may be invalid
- **Hard bounce**: Permanent failure (bad email address)
- **Soft bounce**: Temporary failure (mailbox full, server down)

### email.complained
üö´ Recipient marked email as spam
- Consider removing them from your email list

### email.opened
üëÅÔ∏è Recipient opened the email (tracking pixel)
- Only works if HTML email with tracking enabled

### email.clicked
üñ±Ô∏è Recipient clicked a link in the email
- Shows which URL was clicked

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook returns 401 "Invalid signature"
- Check that `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
- Make sure you copied the full secret from Resend

### No events showing up
- Check Resend dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Recent deliveries
- See if Resend is getting 200 OK responses
- Check your server logs for errors

### Testing locally
Use ngrok to expose localhost:
```bash
ngrok http 5051
# Use the https URL in Resend webhook settings
```

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Signature verification** - Every webhook is verified using HMAC SHA256
‚úÖ **Replay protection** - Timestamps prevent replay attacks
‚úÖ **HTTPS only** - Webhooks only work over HTTPS (Render provides this)
‚úÖ **Secret key** - Never commit your webhook secret to git

## Next Steps After Setup

1. ‚úÖ Add webhook in Resend dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Copy webhook secret to environment variables
3. ‚úÖ Redeploy on Render
4. ‚úÖ Test by sending an email
5. ‚úÖ Verify events appear in database

## Future Enhancements

You can extend the webhook handler to:

- **Auto-retry failed emails** after soft bounces
- **Mark users as invalid** after hard bounces
- **Track engagement metrics** (open rates, click rates)
- **Send notifications** when important emails bounce
- **Create dashboards** showing email delivery stats
- **Automatically unsubscribe** users who mark as spam

## Example Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Delivery success rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'email.delivered' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as delivery_rate
FROM email_events 
WHERE event_type IN ('email.delivered', 'email.bounced');

-- Most engaged users (opened emails)
SELECT 
  recipient, 
  COUNT(*) as opens
FROM email_events 
WHERE event_type = 'email.opened'
GROUP BY recipient 
ORDER BY opens DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Bounce rate by email
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as bounces
FROM email_events 
WHERE event_type = 'email.bounced'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
