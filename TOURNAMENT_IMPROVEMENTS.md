## Technical Details

### Frontend Changes (client/src/App.jsx)

**State Updates**:
```javascript
// Changed from:
const [sport, setSport] = useState('tennis');
const [seedCount, setSeedCount] = useState(4);

// Changed to:
const [sportChoice, setSportChoice] = useState('');
const [customSport, setCustomSport] = useState('');
const [seedCount, setSeedCount] = useState('');

// Added for settings editing:
const [editingSettings, setEditingSettings] = useState(false);
const [editDrawSize, setEditDrawSize] = useState(16);
const [editSeedCount, setEditSeedCount] = useState(4);
const [editPointsByRound, setEditPointsByRound] = useState({});
```

**Form Validation**:
- Sport: Must select from dropdown or enter custom value
- Seeds: Must select from dropdown
- Both validated before tournament creation

**Settings Loading**:
- When tournament detail is loaded, settings are populated into edit state
- Handles both `seed_count` and `seeds_count` fields for compatibility
- Parses `points_by_round` JSON string into object

**Generate Bracket**:
- Now reads from `detail.tournament.draw_size` and `detail.tournament.seed_count`
- Removed local state inputs from generate panel

### Backend Changes (server/server.js)

**New Endpoint**:
```javascript
PATCH /tournaments/:id/settings
Body: {
  managerId: number,
  drawSize: number,
  seeds: number,
  points: { R16: number, QF: number, ... }
}
Response: { ok: true }
```

**Authorization**: Only club manager can update settings

**Database Update**:
- Updates `draw_size`, `seed_count`, `points_by_round` columns
- `points_by_round` stored as JSON string
